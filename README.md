## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) trading platform frontend
- `@repo/ui`: a React component library shared across applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build
yarn dlx turbo build
pnpm exec turbo build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build --filter=web

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build --filter=web
yarn exec turbo build --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=web
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev
yarn exec turbo dev
pnpm exec turbo dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev --filter=web

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev --filter=web
yarn exec turbo dev --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo login

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo login
yarn exec turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo link

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo link
yarn exec turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
```

Step 1: Kill old processes blocking ports
# Kill all Node.js processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Or kill specific ports (if needed)
netstat -ano | findstr ":3000 :3001 :5000 :8080"
# Then use the PID from output:
# taskkill /F /PID <PID_NUMBER>
Step 2: Start Docker Desktop (if not running)
# Start Docker Desktop application manually from Start Menu
# OR if you have Docker CLI:
"C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"
Wait for Docker Desktop to fully start (whale icon in system tray should be stable).
Step 3: Verify Docker is running
docker --version
docker ps
Step 4: Start Docker services for zero_sum_x
cd C:\Users\krish\s30\zero_sum_x\apps\price_poller
docker-compose up -d redis timescale
Step 5: Wait for services to be healthy
# Check status
docker-compose ps

# Wait until both show "healthy" status
Step 6: Start all zero_sum_x dev servers
cd C:\Users\krish\s30\zero_sum_x
pnpm run dev
Summary - All Commands in Order:
# 1. Kill old processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# 2. Start Docker Desktop (manually or via Start Menu)

# 3. Navigate to project and start Docker services
cd C:\Users\krish\s30\zero_sum_x\apps\price_poller
docker-compose up -d redis timescale

# 4. Wait ~10 seconds, then check status
docker-compose ps

# 5. Start dev servers
cd C:\Users\krish\s30\zero_sum_x
pnpm run dev
